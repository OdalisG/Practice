	<h1>The Truth About Water</h1>

	<div id ="about">
		<p><big>W</big>ater, also known as H20 is not only important to humans, but it's also needed by plants, trees and animals. 
		Without water, we would all be in trouble. We as humans not only need water to drink, but we also need it to bathe
		and wash dishes. We need water to wash our cars, rinse our mouth, wash our hair and the list goes on and on. The 
		importance of water is severe. So severe that without it, we would all die. Including the earth.
		Around 70% of the earth surface is made of water. According to the Water Science School,
		96.5% of the water is held by the ocean. <br>
		<big>A</big>ll of the water that falls on our land that is used by us will eventually
evaporate back into the sky as water vapor, which will then replenish our
planet. Unfortunately, that water that ends up falling from the sky
doesn't get evenly distributed around the earth. This can eventually become a 
problem not only for us but for the animals in the sea that depend on water to survive. Without water, an individual
can very easily dehydrate. Once an individuals water level drops below a healthy amount, dangerous symptoms will kick in.
For example, thirst, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, extreme dry mouth, light headed, rapid pulse and breathing.<br>
<big>L</big>ack of water can cause kidney failure along with other organs to fail.
